# Converting-JSON-To-CSV-files
Reinforcing my experience with taking in JSON data and converting it to other formats, using the following idea from the app-ideas repository: https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/JSON2CSV-App.md

### Constraints ###
- You may not use any libraries or packages designed to perform this type of
conversion.
- If you choose to implement this in JavaScript don't use complicated looping
in your first implementation. Instead, use `Object.keys()` and `Object.values`
to generate CSV for the header and data rows.
- Nested JSON structures are not supported.
